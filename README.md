# SASS Crash Course

### About:

Went through a quick crash course covering the basics of SASS.

What is SASS?  Great question.  I had no idea either before today.

SASS is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted into CSSS.

### What I Learned:

* Nested CSS Elements
* "Partials" - Smaller SASS Files that are imported and combined together
* @extend which is similar to extending a Class in Javascript
* @mixin's
* @include
* @each - looping through arrays like a for loop

### Acknowledgement:

Thanks to Traversy Media for teaching me everything about web development, and then some!
